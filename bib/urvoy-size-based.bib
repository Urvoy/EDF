    abstract = {HSDPA/HDR systems allow the use of sophisticated opportunistic schedulers that can utilize information on instantaneous channel conditions. On the other hand, for elastic data traffic the size of the files can be used in size-dependent scheduling methods, e.g., the well known SRPT scheduler, to minimize the flow delays. In this paper, we consider the optimal use of both size and channel information for minimizing the flow delay. We derive several heuristics which utilize both types of information. In a static setting with two flows and two rates, the optimal policy can be constructed via dynamic programming and can be compared against the policies using exact size knowledge. In the dynamic setting (stochastically arriving flows with random sizes), extensive simulations have been performed to evaluate the performance of the schedulers under heavy traffic. In the symmetric setting, the differences between the schedulers are clearly visible, while in the asymmetric setting the dynamics are more complex. The results still show that significant gains can be achieved with additionally using size information.},

We illustrate the unfairness problems caused by the 802.11 MAC protocol, as well as by cross-layer interactions.

These two queue management approaches are designed to alleviate the unfairness among competing TCP flows. The evaluation of these approaches uses the ns-2 network simulator.

The impact is assessed by comparing the flow level delay of the simple RR scheduler to two optimized non-anticipating schedulers (FB and FB�) and SRPT. The optimized distance-aware scheduler FB� is derived by applying the Gittins index approach. Our results show that for Pareto-type file size distributions, the size-based information is more important than the location information. Additionally, FB not only decreases the overall mean delay, but it can also decrease considerably the mean delay of all users independently of their location.},

Our results show that the SAOS schemes can yield significant reduction in the total completion time. We also examine two extreme cases, i.e., wireless shortest processing time first (SRPT) and "riding on the channel peak", which utilize only either the file size information or the instantaneous channel conditions.},

The DPS discipline provides a natural approach for modeling the flow-level performance of differentiated bandwidth-sharing mechanisms. Motivated by the extreme diversity in flow sizes observed in the Internet, we examine the system performance in an asymptotic regime where the flow dynamics of the various classes occur on separate time scales. Specifically, from the perspective of a given class, the arrival and service completions of some of the competing classes (called mice) evolve on an extremely fast time scale. In contrast, the flow dynamics of the remaining classes (referred to as elephants) occur on a comparatively slow time scale. Assuming a strict separation of time scales, we obtain simple explicit expressions for various performance measures of interest, such as the distribution of the numbers of flows, mean delays, and flow throughputs. In particular, the latter performance measures are insensitive, in the sense that they only depend on the service requirement distributions through their first moments. Numerical experiments show that the limiting results provide remarkably accurate approximations in certain cases.},

@inproceedings{Avrachenkov2005Discriminatory,
    abstract = {As a natural multi-class generalization of the well-known (egalitarian) processor sharing (PS) service discipline, discriminatory processor sharing (DPS) is of great interest in many application areas, including telecommunications. Under DPS, the mean response time conditional on the service requirement is only known in closed form when all classes have exponential service requirement distributions. For generally distributed service requirements, Fayolle et al. (1980) showed that the expected conditional response times satisfy a system of integro-differential equations. In this paper, we exploit that result to prove that, provided the system is stable, for each class the expected unconditional response time is finite and that the expected conditional response time has an asymptote. The asymptotic bias of each class is found in closed form, involving the mean service requirements of all classes and the second moments of all classes but the one under consideration. In the course of the development we prove two other results that are of independent interest: we establish a conservation law for the time average unfinished work of all classes and, using a stochastic coupling argument, we show that the response times of different classes are stochastically ordered according to the DPS weights. Finally, we study DPS as a tool to achieve size based scheduling and we provide guidelines as to how the weights of DPS must be chosen such that DPS outperforms PS.},

The approach is general purpose, in that it can be used to estimate the mean and variance of the job response time, for arbitrary arrival processes, service time distributions, and scheduling policies. In the paper, we apply the approach to trace-driven simulation of Web server scheduling to compare and contrast the PS and SRPT scheduling policies. We identify two types of unfairness, called endogenous and exogenous unfairness. We quantify each, focusing on the mean and variance of slowdown, conditioned on job size, for a range of system loads. Finally, we confirm recent theoretical results regarding the asymptotic convergence of scheduling policies with respect to slowdown, and illustrate typical performance results for a practical range of job sizes from an empirical Web server workload.},

@inproceedings{Lu2005Effects,
    abstract = {Recently, size-based policies such as SRPT and FSP have been proposed for scheduling requests in Web servers. SRPT and FSP are superior to policies that ignore request size, such as PS, in both efficiency and fairness, given heavy-tailed service times. However, a central assumption that is usually made in implementing size-based policies in a Web server is that the service time of a request is strongly correlated with the size of the file it serves. By collecting Web server trace data taken from the logs of modified Apache Web servers, this paper reveals that the correlation between service time and file size can be quite low, and shows how the performance of SRPT and FSP can be dramatically affected by the weak correlation via trace-driven simulations. In response, we propose and evaluate domain-based scheduling, a simple technique that better estimates connection times by making use of the source IP address of the request. Domain-based scheduling improves SRPT and FSP performance on Web servers, bringing the performance benefits of these scheduling polices even to those regimes where the correlation between file size and service time is low.},

T-SRPT is a hybrid policy that dynamically switches from PS (processor sharing) to SRPT when the number of jobs in the system exceeds T, and back to PS when the load diminishes. Slowdown profile plots are used to analyze the performance of these policies relative to PS, SRPT, and FSP (fair sojourn protocol).

@inproceedings{Pollin2005Delay,
    abstract = {Delay optimization is an important issue for ad hoc wireless networks supporting multimedia applications. Current medium access schemes do not take the application packet size into account for their operation. Long packets win the channel contention equally likely as the smaller packets; however, they occupy the channel for a longer time. This unfairness leads to increased delay and jitter for smaller packets. This paper attempts to resolve the above issue by proposing a fully distributed algorithm that adapts the contention process to the packet size as well. More specifically, we emulate the shortest job first scheduling policy by proposing a new resetting backoff regime. The proposed scheme is then compared to the distributed coordination function of the IEEE 802.11 standard. Analytical and simulation results show that the delay of the small packets is significantly improved.},
