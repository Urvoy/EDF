    Abstract = {Measurement and analysis of current behavior are valuable techniques for the study of computer networks. In addition to providing insight into the operation and usage patterns of present networks, the results can be used to create realistic models of their traffic sources. Such models are a key component of the analytic and simulation studies often undertaken in the design of future networks. This paper presents measurements of wide area Internet traffic gathered at the junction between a large industrial research laboratory and the rest of the Internet. Using bar graphs and histograms, it shows the statistics obtained for packet counts, byte counts, and packet length frequencies, broken down by major transport protocols and network services.}
